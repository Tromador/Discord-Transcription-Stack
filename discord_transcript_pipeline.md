# Discord Audio Transcript Deduplication Pipeline

This document outlines the complete processing pipeline used to transform Discord voice session recordings into a clean, deduplicated transcript. It includes toolchain descriptions, code usage, and reasoning behind each processing step.

## 🎙 Phase 0: Discord Audio Capture

**Script Used**: `index.ts`

Captures individual `.wav` files from a live Discord voice channel using Discord.js and `@discordjs/voice`.

### Features:
- Captures audio **per user**, identified by Discord `user_id`
- Uses `start_speaking` and `stop_speaking` events for stream control
- Converts Opus streams to WAV:
  - Decodes with `prism-media` into PCM
  - Encodes into WAV with `wav.Writer` at 48kHz mono, 16-bit
- Writes each audio stream to a timestamped `.wav` file in a daily subdirectory
- Records session metadata into a `session_log.jsonl` per day:
  - `user` (name mapping if available)
  - `user_id`
  - `start` and `end` timestamps (ISO format)
  - `filename` (relative to day directory)
- **Handles multiple streams per user** (supports overlapping or simultaneous speaking events)
- **Failsafe for unresolved pipelines** (timeouts to prevent orphaned streams)
- **Graceful shutdown on SIGINT**:
  - Cleans up voice connection and Discord client
  - Closes all active listeners
  - Forces process exit after a delay if needed
- Configured via `.env`:
  - `DISCORD_TOKEN`
  - `GUILD_ID`
  - `CHANNEL_ID`
- Static mapping for friendly user names based on known Discord `user_id`s
- Logs key events (start/stop speaking, recording success/failure)

### Example Output:

```plaintext
audio/2025-05-04/
├── user_340336807222837270_16-22-12.wav
├── user_..._.wav
└── session_log.jsonl

This log is the first input into the pipeline via `dedupe_audit.py`.
```

## ✅ Phase 1: Audio Validation and Filtering

**Script Used**: `dedupe_audit.py`  
**Helper Module**: `burst_scope.py`

Purpose: Clean up raw `.wav` files exported from Discord (one per user per utterance) and discard files with no usable content. Performs detailed validation, including duplicate detection, silence filtering, VAD-based speech detection, and burst-based rescue of very short utterances.

### Key Logic:
- **SHA-256 Fingerprinting**: Detects exact duplicate audio files via hash comparison, ensuring files aren't redundantly processed.
- **Filename Duplicate Check**: Flags files that appear more than once based on name.
- **Duration Extraction**: Reads duration directly from the WAV header using `soundfile`.
- **RMS Energy Filtering**: Files with total RMS energy below a threshold (0.003) are discarded as effectively silent.
- **Silero VAD Detection**: Uses the Silero VAD model to detect speech within the audio file:
  - Files with no detected speech are rejected.
  - Files shorter than `--vad-min-duration` (default 2.0s) can be rescued.
- **Burst Scope Rescue** (`burst_scope.py`):
  - Short, sharp energy bursts (e.g., "Yes", "Okay") bypass VAD rejection if they meet burst criteria.
  - Files passing the `is_bursty_candidate()` test are tagged with an override flag `"override": "burst_scope"`.
- **Legacy Text Similarity Filter** (currently commented out):
  - Originally filtered out generic filler transcriptions (e.g., "uh", "yes"), but is now inactive.
- **Mode Handling**:
  - `--mode` controls whether the script actually writes the audit log (`default="dry-run"`).
  - If not in dry-run mode, writes results to `dedupe_audit.jsonl`.
- **Detailed Audit Summary**:
  - Reports total files, accepted files, SHA-256 and filename duplicates, RMS rejects, VAD rejections (short/long), and burst rescues.
  - Prints the final audit log output path.

### Example Command:
    python3 dedupe_audit.py \
      --log-file audio/2025-05-04/session_log.jsonl \
      --audio-dir audio/2025-05-04 \
      --model-dir models/silero-vad \
      --output dedupe_audit_2025-05-04.v2.jsonl \
      --vad-min-duration 2.0

- `--mode` can be omitted (defaults to dry-run) or set to `full` to write the output.
- `--vad-min-duration` controls the short utterance threshold (default 2.0s).

### 🧙 Helper Module: `burst_scope.py`

Used by `dedupe_audit.py` to rescue very short utterances that were rejected by VAD but show bursty characteristics. Provides an RMS-based burstiness analysis for audio files.

#### Features:
- Reads `.wav` files and computes:
  - **Total RMS**: Overall energy level of the file.
  - **Frame-based RMS**: Divides audio into small frames (default 20ms) and computes RMS for each.
  - **Standard Deviation of RMS**: Measures how much the energy fluctuates between frames.
- **Burstiness Criteria**:
  - File passes if `std_rms > 0.03` (default) and `total RMS > 0.003`.
  - Indicates sharp, dynamic bursts (e.g., “Yes”, “Okay”) rather than continuous hum.
- **Import-safe**: `is_bursty_candidate(filepath)` can be called from other scripts.
- **Standalone CLI Usage**:
      python3 burst_scope.py path/to/audio.wav

  - Prints duration, total RMS, frame RMS standard deviation, and a summary.
  - Optionally displays an RMS plot using `matplotlib` (if available).

#### Example Diagnostic Output:
    📄 File: user_340336807222837270_16-22-12.wav
    ⏱ Duration: 1.23 seconds
    🔋 Total RMS: 0.005432
    📈 Frame RMS std: 0.045321
       Max Frame RMS: 0.091200
       Min Frame RMS: 0.000000
    💥 Bursty Signal? YES
    ✅ Candidate for Whisper rescue

Used in `dedupe_audit.py` to override short VAD-rejected utterances when `is_bursty_candidate()` returns `True`.

## 🧠 Phase 2: Whisper Transcription

**Script Used**: `transcribe_accepted.py`

Reads the filtered metadata from `dedupe_audit.py` and performs Whisper transcription on the retained audio files.

### Features:
- Loads entries from JSONL where `"status": "accepted"`
- Transcribes each `.wav` file using `faster-whisper` (CTranslate2 backend)
  - Beam search with beam size 5
  - Joins segment texts with spaces
- Adds a `"text"` field to each entry with the transcription result
- Skips missing audio files with warnings
- Outputs an updated `.jsonl` with the transcribed text included
- Sets compute type to "auto" and restricts CPU threads to 1

### Example Command:
    python3 transcribe_accepted.py \
      --input-log dedupe_audit_2025-05-04.v2.jsonl \
      --audio-dir ../discord_audio_bot/audio/2025-05-04 \
      --model-dir models/whisper-large-v3-f16 \
      --output-jsonl session_log.transcribed.jsonl

### Notes:
- `--input-log` points to the filtered log output by `dedupe_audit.py`
- `--audio-dir` contains the audio files (`.wav`) referenced in the log
- `--model-dir` specifies the directory containing the faster-whisper model
- `--output-jsonl` is where the transcribed log with text will be saved

### Example JSONL Entry (after transcription):
    {
      "user": "Stef",
      "user_id": "881203221593464864",
      "start": "2025-05-04T16:22:12.345Z",
      "end": "2025-05-04T16:22:15.678Z",
      "filename": "user_881203221593464864_16-22-12.wav",
      "status": "accepted",
      "text": "Here is the transcribed text of the audio."
    }

## 🧹 Phase 3: Deduplication by Clustering

**Script Used**: `dedupe_transcript.py` 

### Clustering Features:
- **Token-based matching** with Jaccard and Cosine similarity
- **Fragment rule** collapses short utterances that are strict subsets of longer ones
- **Canonical form comparison**:
  - Lowercase normalisation
  - Punctuation stripping
  - Specific contraction expansion (e.g., "we're" → "we are")
- **Cluster best pick** selection via scoring:
  - Weighted length, punctuation count, initial capitalisation bonus
  - Penalties for filler words (e.g., "uh", "um")
- **Per-speaker clustering** to prevent cross-user confusion
- **Final pass** deduplication:
  - Merges entries with high Jaccard (≥0.85) or Cosine similarity (≥0.92) even if not clustered initially
- **Optional containment filtering** (enabled with `--filter-contained`):
  - Removes entries fully contained in longer utterances by the same speaker, based on start/end times and durations
- **Debug output** (enabled with `--debug-clusters`):
  - Detailed per-speaker cluster breakdowns with best pick entries and cluster sizes
- **Deduplication summary**:
  - Total users processed
  - Total and deduplicated utterance counts
  - Per-user cluster reduction ratios

```
python3 dedupe_transcript.py \
  --input-jsonl session_log.transcribed.jsonl \
  --output-text transcript_2025-05-04.deduped.txt \
  --debug-clusters cluster_debug.txt \
  --filter-contained
```

Optional:
- Debug output: cluster breakdowns to review merge quality

## 📝 Output

A final `.txt` file with a per-line speaker label:

```plaintext
Trish: First mate. First mate.
Stef: subject to an appropriate skill roll.
Rich: I wonder...
```

Preserves:
- Character
- Flow
- Cleaned dialogue
- Session integrity
